[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e70440c6-c477-480c-af02-530139b01c6b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/projects/bomb-pot/deploys)

This is a mobile-responsive web application designed to be used during a friendly poker game. Once per orbit, a player can tap the "Select Game" button to randomly select a limit bomb pot game. The app features a realistic slot machine rolling animation, complete with synthesized Web Audio ticking and a winning chime.

## Managing the Games List

The list of games displayed on the slot machine roller is fully customizable and easily accessible. 

To add, modify, or remove games:
1. Open the `src/games.json` file.
2. Edit the array of text strings to include your desired games. 
3. Save the file. The slot machine will automatically update and randomly select from your new list!

*Example `src/games.json`:*
```json
[
  "4 Card Omaha Hi",
  "4 Card Omaha Hi-Lo",
  "Crazy Pineapple Double Board"
]
```
